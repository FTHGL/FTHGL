# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I am Abdurrahman Fatihoğlu, a 4th-year student who will graduate from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Konya Technical University. Throughout my university education, I aimed to advance my skills in embedded system development to better understand embedded systems. In addition to this, I have continuously improved and am continuing to improve myself in areas such as PCB hardware design, communication with RF signals, and chip design (IC design). I want to use the valuable experiences I have gained to further professionalize myself in these areas and to become an effective professional in the industry.
